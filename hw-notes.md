### Lesson 1 - Introduction (09/21/2021)

#### Language usage and Misunderstanding

When facing sentences like `Abby does not like Cody or Dana.`, you need to understand this by language-sense not logic sense. This means `Abby does not like Cody and, Abby does not like Dana.`. In logic sense, this could be interpreted as the sentene is `TRUE` if `Abby does not like Cody is TRUE or Abby does not like Dana is TRUE`.

#### Possible worlds and Entailments

A group of premises could generate a series of worlds. If we are arguing whether we can entail a logic *L* from these premises, we need to ensure that every world allows this entailment. Otherwise, if there exists a world that this entailment is disallowed, we say this group of premises could not entail the logic statement.
