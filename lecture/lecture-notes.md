### Lesson 2 - Propositional Logics

#### Propositional Logics and Variable

Variable naming has certain rules, it starts with, always with, lower cased letter. And it should only contains numeric values or English letters.

#### Type of Propositional Logics (Operator)

* Negation
* Conjunction
* Disjunction
* Implication
* Equivalence

All these basic primitives can be embedded in much complicated logic sentences combined with logic variables (see naming conventions for these in the section above).

#### Association Rules of Propositional Logics (Operator)

* If surrounded by two occurences of AND or OR, the association rule can go left or right, it does not really matter that much.

* If surrounded by IMPLICATION or EQUIVALENCE, the association rule can ONLY goes to the right. (Same Operators!!!)

#### If and only if with Equivalence

Note that this is the equivalent to the conjunction of the two implications shown above. The biconditional captures this conjunction in a more compact form.

#### Translation between English Sentencens and Propositional Logics

---
* All purple mushrooms are poisonous.
* purple & mushroom => poisonous
---
* A mushroom is poisonous only if it is purple.	
* poisonous & mushroom => purple
---
* A mushroom is not poisonous unless it is purple. 	
* poisonous & mushroom => purple
---
* No purple mushroom is poisonous.	
* ~(purple & mushroom & poisonous)


### Lesson 3 - Propositional Analysis

#### Important Notes

The entailment sign is just a meta symbol! Not a logic operator! There are homework problem asking you about this, so try not to be confused.

#### Properties of Sentences

* Valid
* Contingent
* Unsatisfiable
* Satisfiable
* Falsifiable

#### Important Properties

When you review, you may need to refer to [the slides](http://intrologic.stanford.edu/intrologic/lectures/lecture_03.pdf)

* Double Negation
* deMorgan's Laws
* Implication Introduction
* Implication Distribution
* Implication Reversal

#### Important Properties between Sentences

* Logical Equivalence
* Logical Entailment
* Logical Consistency

#### Propositional Metatheorems

* Equivalence Theorem
* Deduction Theorem
* Unsatisfiability Theorem
* Consistency Theorem
