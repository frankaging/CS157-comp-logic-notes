### Lesson 1 - Introduction (09/21/2021)

#### Language usage and Misunderstanding

When facing sentences like `Abby does not like Cody or Dana.`, you need to understand this by language-sense not logic sense. This means `Abby does not like Cody and, Abby does not like Dana.`. In logic sense, this could be interpreted as the sentene is `TRUE` if `Abby does not like Cody is TRUE or Abby does not like Dana is TRUE`.

#### Possible worlds and Entailments

A group of premises could generate a series of worlds. If we are arguing whether we can entail a logic *L* from these premises, we need to ensure that every world allows this entailment. Otherwise, if there exists a world that this entailment is disallowed, we say this group of premises could not entail the logic statement.

### Lesson 3 - Introduction (09/21/2021)

#### Equivalence, Entailment, and Consistency

If A and B are false in every case, they entail each other. However, the definition of consistency says they would only be consistent if (A ∧ B) is satisfiable, which it is not.

* Equivalence: A sentence A and a sentence B are logically equivalent if and only if the sentence (A <=> B) is valid.

* Entailment: If A and B are false in every case, they entail each other. And if whenever A is true, B is true, A entails B. 

* Consistency: They would only be consistent if (A ∧ B) is satisfiable.
